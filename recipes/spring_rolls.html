    <h4>My favorite appetizer! It would be cheaper if you make it at home.</h4>
    <h3>Ingredients:</h3>
    <h5>For the spring rolls</h5>
    <ul>
        <li>1 pack of rice vermicelli</li>
        <li>1lb of pork belly</li>
        <li>1 small shallot</li>
        <li>1lb shrimp</li>
        <li>1 head lettuce</li>
        <li>An assortment of herbs and vegetable (mint, thai basil)</li>
    </ul>

    <h5>For the peanut sauce</h5>
    <ul>
        <li>1 tablespoon neutral oil</li>
        <li>½ tablespoon minced garlic</li>
        <li>½ tablespoon minced shallot</li>
        <li>½ cup (120g) smooth peanut butter</li>
        <li>½ cup (128g) hoisin sauce</li>
        <li>1 cup reserved pork belly cooking liquid</li>
        <li>sambal oelek chili sauce (optional)</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Instructions:</h3>
    <h5>Preparing the fillings</h5>
    <ol>
        <li>Cook the vermicelli according to the package's instructions. Drain and rinse the noodles and set aside to
            cool.</li>
        <li>Wash and dry all of the herbs and vegetables you plan on using.</li>
        <li>Add the pork belly and a peeled shallot to a pot of boiling water and cook for about 20 minutes, or until a
            fork/chopstick easily pierces the meat and the liquid coming out of it runs clear.</li>
        <li>Remove the pork belly to cool but keep the cooking liquid. Slice the pork belly thinly.</li>
        <li>Add 1 tablespoon water to a small saucepan or pan and cook the shrimp on medium high heat until the shrimp
            are pink and no longer translucent. Let them cool before peeling them and slicing them in half.</li>
    </ol>
    <h5>Making the peanut dipping sauce</h5>
    <ol>
        <li>In a small saucepan, sauté the minced garlic and shallot in a tablespoon of oil on medium heat.</li>
        <li>Add the peanut butter, hoisin sauce, and reserved pork cooking liquid and stir until smooth.</li>
        <li>If you want a spicy peanut sauce, add a tablespoon or two of sambal oelek to taste.</li>
    </ol>
    <h5>Assembling the spring rolls</h5>
    <ol>
        <li>Start by dipping a sheet of rice paper into a bowl of warm water QUICKLY. It's likely the rice paper will
            still feel stiff in your hands. It will continue to soften as you assemble the fillings. Do NOT submerge the
            rice paper in water until it is soft, as it will fall apart by the time you are ready to roll.</li>
        Layer the shrimp cut side up on one end of the rice paper, followed by the pork belly, then herbs, then noodles,
        followed lastly by the lettuce.</li>
        <li>Roll the filling snugly once, then fold the sides of the rice paper towards the middle. Roll the rest of the
            fillings all the way to the other end of the rice paper.</li>
        <li>Serve the spring rolls with the peanut dipping sauce. You can add some crushed peanuts to the sauce for
            extra crunch.</li>
    </ol>
